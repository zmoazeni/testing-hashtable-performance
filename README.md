testing-hastable-performance
============================

This is a repo to test out the performance between the [hashtables](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hashtables) package and the HashMap from [unordered-containers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/unordered-containers).

On my OSX machine, the unordered-containers are consistently faster.

Requirements: GHC v7.6.3, cabal-install >= 1.18

## To Run: ##

    make
    make run
